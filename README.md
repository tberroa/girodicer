The Girodicer project served as my senior capstone project at Boston University.

This repository only contains the code for the Android mobile app portion of 
the Girodicer project. The purpose of this repository is to preserve the code 
I wrote, just in case the original repository is taken down. The original 
repository should be located at https://github.com/lasoren/ice-dam-drone. 

# Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a drone capable of autonomously scanning 
a slanted residential roof to detect and alleviate ice dams.

The drone would utilize thermal image processing to detect warm spots where ice 
dams are likely to form downwards from that point. In addition, the drone would 
take pictures of the perimeter of the roof, process the images to look for icicles 
(a sign of a forming ice dam), and make note of the problem area. The drone would 
be capable of distributing calcium chloride (a non-corrosive salt) within a porous 
fabric sleeve onto an ice dam to prevent further damage to the roof. A smartphone 
app would serve as the interface for the user, displaying information such as 
rooftop images and battery life. 

The drone provides a safer and cheaper alternative to removing ice dams compared to the
dangers of manual removal or expensive roof heating solutions.
